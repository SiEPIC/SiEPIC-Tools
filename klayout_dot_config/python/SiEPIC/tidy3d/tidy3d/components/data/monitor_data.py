            The dot product with and without conjugation is equivalent (up to a phase) for

            the conjugated dot product can be interpreted as the fraction of the power of the first
            mode carried by the second, but modes are not orthogonal with respect to that product
            and the sum of carried power fractions exceed 1. In the non-conjugated definition,
            orthogonal modes can be defined, but the interpretation of modal overlap as power
            carried by a given mode is no longer valid.
