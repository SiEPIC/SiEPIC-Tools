# Sample Github Action that sets up docker container using image in this repo 

name: Sample Github Action 

# Specify this github action to run on (i) a push to main or any branch, and (ii) a pull request to main
# Note: Since this is a sample action we don't want it to run. We cannot leave this empty and have put 
#       a placeholder to ensure it doesn't run. Delete the current code and uncomment the commented code when you
#       want this action to run.

        # - name: Copy pymacros folder to docker container (needed to run EBeam_Lib_PCellTests.py)
        #   run: docker cp $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/klayout/EBeam/pymacros ebeam_test:/home/pymacros
